The application is incomplete but I know I would of been able to complete it if I had put more time into it.

The main feature that I wanted to implement but couldn't achieve was to have create, edit and delete partial views in popup modals.
I tried this using Bootstrap's modals first, then JQuery UI's modals both unsuccessful. I also tried using Ajax forms
and some Javascript functions. Most of the code is still included, commented out.

I also didn't successfully implement the many to many relationship. Instead I seeded the actors into the movies to get the 
programme to run. I imagined it would do more for me marks as opposed to having a non-running programme marked out of 70.
But doing this has caused the delete function to stop working, it gives an error about a conflict on a column it the 
database, caused by the messy seeding. With the data in this mess I was unable to display a details page for each actor.
